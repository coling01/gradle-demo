# gradle-demo

Simple demo to demonstrate a few things

* Logging config to allow json logging with fields defined in logback.xml
* MDS trace and span ids to be generated and added to logging
* Request filter to show how we can easily pickoff jwt
* Request filter to show adding trace and span ids to response 

Single integration test to hit local endpoint to illustrate this stuff
